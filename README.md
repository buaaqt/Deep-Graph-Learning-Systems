# Deep-Graph-Learning-Systems


A reading list for deep graph learning system. Including but not limited to system design and optimization in the direction of graph deep learning. Covers related papers, conferences, tools, books, blogs, courses and other resources. We have a [team](#Maintainer) responsible for maintaining this list, and everyone is welcome to contribute together.
